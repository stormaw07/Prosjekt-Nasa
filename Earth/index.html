                    While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our 
                    solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is 
                    the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal. <br>
                    Earth is the only planet in the solar system whose English name does not come from Greek or Roman 
                    mythology. The name was taken from Old English and Germanic. It simply means "the ground." There are, 
                    of course, many names for our planet in the thousands of languages spoken by the people of the third 
                    planet from the Sun.
