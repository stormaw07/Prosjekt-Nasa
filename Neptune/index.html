                    Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant 
                    major planet orbiting our Sun. More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is 
                    not visible to the naked eye. In 2011, Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its 
                    discovery. <br> 
                    The planetâ€™s rich blue color comes from methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red wavelengths 
                    of light, but allows blue ones to be reflected back into space.
