                    Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and it's the third largest planet in our solar system â€“ 
                    about four times wider than Earth. The diameter at its equator is 31,763 miles (51,120 kilometers). <br>
                    Uranus is a very cold and windy planet. It is surrounded by faint rings, and more than two dozen small 
                    moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes 
                    Uranus appear to spin on its side
