                    Pluto is a dwarf planet located in a distant region of our solar system beyond Neptune known as the 
                    Kuiper Belt. Pluto was long considered our ninth planet, but the International Astronomical Union 
                    reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet in 2006. <br>
                    NASA's New Horizons was the first spacecraft to explore Pluto up close, flying by the dwarf planet 
                    and its moons in 2015. It found that Pluto is a complex world with mountains, valleys, plains, craters, 
                    and apparently even glaciers. <br>
                    Pluto was discovered in 1930 by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, 
                    Arizona. It was named by 11-year-old Venetia Burney of Oxford, England.
