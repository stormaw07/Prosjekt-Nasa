                    Earth's Moon is the brightest and largest object in our night sky. The Moon makes Earth a more 
                    livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable 
                    climate. It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years. <br>
                    The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth several billion years ago. <br>

                    until Galileo Galilei discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610. In Latin, the Moon was called Luna, 
                    which is the main adjective for all things Moon-related: lunar
